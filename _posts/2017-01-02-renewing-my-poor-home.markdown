If you gave me all the money  
I would buy such ordinary  
Things like TV, magazines and coffee beans  
I have such simple needs  
Tried on thirty different pairs of shoes  
And not one made me want to  
Leave this blessed house of mine  
That's just fine  
I really don't want to go anywhere  
I don't really wanna go anywhere  
I don't really wanna go anywhere  
I am dented  
By the scars that keep me up at night  
And it's not agoraphobia, it's just a lack of  
Air supply that keeps me up at night  
I know I'm getting older  
But I'm told that I'm not momentarily out of my mind  
Don't need to be hospitalized  
To make me realize that I've got a problem  
No I haven't, let me be  
I really don't want to go anywhere  
I don't really wanna go anywhere  
I don't really wanna go anywhere  
But I am dented  
By the scars that keep me up at night  
And it's not agoraphobia, it's just a lack of  
Air supply that keeps me up at night  
I know I'm getting older  
But I'm told that I'm not momentarily out of my  
I don't really wanna go anywhere  
I don't really wanna go anywhere  
I don't really wanna go anywhere  
I don't really wanna go anywhere  
I don't really wanna go anywhere  
I don't really wanna go anywhere  
I will not go I don't really wanna go anywhere  
I am dented  
By the scars that keep me up at night  
And it's not agoraphobia, it's just a lack of  
Air supply that keeps me up at night  
I know I'm getting older  
But I'm told that I'm not momentarily out of my mind
